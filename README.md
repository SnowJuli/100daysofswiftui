# 100daysofswiftui
---

Hello and welcome in this repository!

This will be my result of the [#100DaysofSwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) to learn Swift and other stuff about iOS/MacOS Development. 

I will (hopefully) keep track of it every day by providing a folder for each day which will explain the topic of the day aswell as my code of the day with explanations.

If you like this repository, please leave a star as well as open issues if you want to give me tips about how I could improve some lines of code :)
