# Variables and basic types
---

##  Variables

In Swift you declare variables with the `var` keyword followed by the name of the variable aswell as an `=` and the value of it.

Example:

```swift
var name = "Juli"
```

## Constants

Constants use the `let` keyword instead of the `var` keyword for declaration. This form is immutable and useful for saving values that will never change.

Example: 
```swift
let days = 100
```

## Naming convention

Swift established the Camel Case naming convention for its variables and other stuff. It starts with a lower case word followed by every other word uppercased but without any spaces.

## Multi-line Strings

In Swift you can use `"""` to declare a multi-line string which can handle line breaks

Example: 
```swift
var hello = """
Hello
world.
"""
```
