## Type annotations

For type annotations you can use the following keywords:

`String` - String
`Int` - Integer
`Double` - Double
`Bool` - Boolean

Those can be applied for normal variables, consts, enums, arrays and sets

Example:
```swift
var counter: Int

var weekdays: [String]

var seasons: Set<String>
```
